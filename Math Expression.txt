Data Defination: Mathemtical Expression
Mathemtical Expression is String
interp. a string consists of numbers and symbols
rules:
-the number can have a sign infront of it which is either - or +
-cannot contain more than one * or / respectivly for example 2**2 is an invalid expression
-the number can consist of more than one digit and can be decimal

examples:
validExpression = "12+65*-56/8.5"
invalidExpression = "-23**4+340"

Function Defination for numbersExtractor:
Signature: MathmeticalExpression -> List<float>
Purpose: parses a math. expression and returns each component individually

stub:
public List<float> extractNumbers(String exp) {
	return new List<float>();
}

steps:
1.create a stack
2.create a list of floats
3.create a temp variable of type String
4.iterate over the string:
	-if stack empty (if current is either a number or a sign):
		-push the current element to the stack
	-peek the last element
	-if the last element is an operator or a number and the current is a number:
		-push the current element to the stack
	-if the last element is a number and the current element is an operator:
		-pop all the elements from the stack
		-concat them all in a reversed order one string
		-convert it to a float and add it the array of floats
		-add the current element to the array as well
5.pop the elements until the stack is empty
6.add the elements as the last element of the array
7.return the array of floats
