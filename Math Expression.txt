Data Defination: Mathemtical Expression
Mathemtical Expression is String
interp. a string consists of numbers and symbols
rules:
-the number can have a sign infront of it which is either - or +
-cannot contain more than one * or / respectivly for example 2**2 is an invalid expression
-the number can consist of more than one digit and can be decimal

examples:
validExpression = "12+65*-56/8.5"
invalidExpression = "-23**4+340"

Function Defination for numbersExtractor:
Signature: MathmeticalExpression -> List<float>
Purpose: parses a math. expression and returns each component individually

stub:
public List<float> extractNumbers(String exp) {
	return new List<float>();
}

steps:
1.create a stack
2.create a list of floats
3.create a temp variable of type String
4.iterate over the string:
	-if stack empty (if current is either a number or a sign):
		-push the current element to the stack
	-peek the last element
	-if the last element is an operator or a number and the current is a number:
		-push the current element to the stack
	-if the last element is a number and the current element is an operator:
		-pop all the elements from the stack
		-concat them all in a reversed order one string
		-convert it to a float and add it the array of floats
		-add the current element to the array as well
5.pop the elements until the stack is empty
6.add the elements as the last element of the array
7.return the array of floats


Function Defination - Evaluate Expressions:

Signature: List<Float> -> float
Purpose: takes a list that represents numbers along with the operations on them
1.create two stacks one for the numbers and one for the symbols
2.prepare the 2 stacks with data and operations:
-iterate over the array:
	-if the current element is a number:
		-push to numbers stack
	-if the current element is an operator:
		-if operators stack empty -> push the current to the stack
		-peek the last element in operators stack
		-if current is higher or equal in presedence than the last element:
			-push the current to operators stack
		-else:
			-pop the last element
			-push the current
			-push the last element

3.get the data back and apply the operations:
-while numbers stack size > 1 do:
	-pop 2 element from numbers stack
	-pop 1 element from operator stack
	-apply operation on these 2 numbers
	-push the result to the numbers stack
-return numbers.pop the last element
